## Summary
Welcome to Luck Duel. It is a game that tests your luck through a deck of cards. 
 
First the user input the number of players (from 1 to 5) and the number of Joker cards (from 1 to 5) that will be distributed randomly among the drawn cards. The more Joker cards harder is the game. Cards are drawn randomly and shuffled with the amount of Joker cards it was chosen before and put on the table faced down.
The sum of all the cards is 12. The objective of the game is to avoid the joker cards that are placed among other cards.
Each player in his turn have to choose one of the face down cards and face it up. If it’s a Joker then he loses. If all the Jokers in game are face up then all the cards are shuffled again and put face down on the table with the Jokers.
The player that remains in game wins.
 
On Single Player Mode, you accumulate score by choosing other cards than Jokers. The more Joker cards in game more score you get. If you picked all the cards but the Jokers then you receive bonus score and all the cards are shuffled again and put face down on the table with the Jokers. If you pick a Joker it’s Game Over.
